New username: Your target GitHub username (e.g., muzimu). Associated email: The email associated with your GitHub account. Step 1: Batch Modify Author Names of Historical Commits # For scenarios with multiple commits already made, use git filter-branch to rewrite all commit author information in the current branch in batches. Copy and execute the command directly (only need to modify 3 parameters):\n# Batch modify author name and email for all commits in current branch git filter-branch --env-filter \u0026#39; # 3 parameters to modify OLD_NAME=\u0026#34;YourOldGitName\u0026#34; NEW_NAME=\u0026#34;YourGitHubUsername\u0026#34; NEW_EMAIL=\u0026#34;YourGitHubEmail\u0026#34; # No need to modify below if [ \u0026#34;$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;$OLD_NAME\u0026#34; ]; then export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME=\u0026#34;$NEW_NAME\u0026#34; export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL=\u0026#34;$NEW_EMAIL\u0026#34; fi if [ \u0026#34;$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME\u0026#34; = \u0026#34;$OLD_NAME\u0026#34; ]; then export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME=\u0026#34;$NEW_NAME\u0026#34; export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL=\u0026#34;$NEW_EMAIL\u0026#34; fi \u0026#39; -- --all After execution, the terminal will display Rewrite xxx (x/x) indicating that it is rewriting commits. A final message Ref 'refs/heads/yourBranchName' was rewritten means the modification is successful. If there is a cache conflict, first execute rm -rf .git/refs/original/ to clear the cache and then re-run the above command. Step 2: Safely Force Push to Remote Branch # After modifying local commit history, the local and remote branch records are inconsistent, and a force push is needed to overwrite the remote branch (PR will sync automatically):\n# Step 1: Refresh locally cached remote branch information (avoid stale info errors) git fetch origin yourFeatureBranchName # e.g., git fetch origin fix_typo # Step 2: Safe force push (recommended to prevent accidental overwrites) git push --force-with-lease origin yourFeatureBranchName # e.g., git push --force-with-lease origin fix_typo # Alternative: If the above command still errors, directly force push (only for branches you developed yourself) # git push -f origin yourFeatureBranchName After a successful push, the terminal will prompt rewriting history or Total 0 (delta 0). Step 3: Verify Modification Results # Local verification: Execute git log to check if all commits\u0026rsquo; Author: fields have been updated to the new username. Remote verification: Open the GitHub PR page, refresh it, and the author names of all commits will update synchronously and can properly link to your GitHub account avatar. Step 4: Configure Default Author for New Commits # To prevent new commits from using the old username again, configure Git information for the current repository or globally:\n# Apply to current repository only (recommended to avoid affecting other repositories) git config user.name \u0026#34;YourGitHubUsername\u0026#34; git config user.email \u0026#34;YourGitHubEmail\u0026#34; # Apply globally (all new commits in local repositories will use this configuration) # git config --global user.name \u0026#34;YourGitHubUsername\u0026#34; # git config --global user.email \u0026#34;YourGitHubEmail\u0026#34; Common Pitfalls # 1. Force push error: \u0026ldquo;stale info\u0026rdquo; # Reason: The locally cached remote branch information is inconsistent with the actual state on GitHub, and the --force-with-lease safety mechanism rejects the push. Solution: First execute git fetch origin yourBranchName to refresh the cache, then re-push. 2. Commits cannot be linked to GitHub account after modification # Reason: The newly configured user.email is not associated with your GitHub account. Solution: Add and verify the email in GitHub\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Settings → Emails\u0026rdquo;.

What is the Actor Model? # The Actor model is a conceptual model for concurrent computing that originated in 1973. In the Actor model, the Actor is the basic unit of computation, and everything is considered an Actor.\nBasic operations of an Actor:\nCreate another Actor Send messages Specify how to handle the next message Actors can maintain their own state and decide how to process the next message based on their current state.\nExample: An Actor maintains the total account balance. When receiving a new transaction message, it updates the balance in its state. For the next message, the Actor\u0026rsquo;s state will have changed.\nActors are very lightweight and can be easily created in thousands or even millions because they require fewer resources than threads. Actors are isolated from each other and do not share memory. Each has its own state, but the only way to change state is by receiving messages. Each Actor has its own mailbox, similar to a message queue. Messages are stored in the mailbox, and Actors process messages in FIFO (First-In-First-Out) order. Actors can only communicate through messages. Messages are simple immutable data structures that can be easily transmitted over a network. An Actor can only process one message at a time. Actors are decoupled and work asynchronously without waiting for responses from other Actors. Actors have multiple addresses. They can only send messages to Actors with known addresses, which include their own address, addresses of child Actors, addresses of sender Actors from received messages, and addresses of other instances of the same Actor type. An Actor can have multiple addresses (instances). Addresses are not equivalent to an Actor\u0026rsquo;s unique identity.\nActors can run locally or remotely (on other machines). Since the Actor model communicates through addresses, local or remote calls are completely transparent to the system. 2. Fault Tolerance Mechanism # In the Actor model, Actors can supervise their child Actors, including liveness detection, restarting, and redirection after message failure, achieving self-healing capabilities.\n3. Pros and Cons Summary # Pros # Easy to scale Strong fault tolerance capabilities Supports distributed deployment Effectively avoids traditional concurrency issues Cons # Risk of deadlocks Message queues may overflow The Actor model is a conceptual model, and its specific performance and characteristics depend on the specific implementation framework. Currently, well-known implementation frameworks include Akka and Elixir.\nArticle content source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwEdb_pD0k\n","date":"24 January 2026","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/posts/game/actor/","section":"Blog","summary":"Many game development frameworks adopt the Actor model.

}, function(error) { cc.error(\u0026#34;连接失败:\u0026#34;, JSON.stringify(error)); } ); 然后接下来加入一个聊天频道并发送一条消息：\nsocket.onchannelmessage = function (channelMessage) { cc.log(\u0026#34;成功接收聊天消息:\u0026#34;, JSON.stringify(channelMessage)); }; const channelId = \u0026#34;pineapple-pizza-lovers-room\u0026#34;; const persistence = false; const hidden = false; socket.joinChat(channelId, 1, persistence, hidden).then( function(response) { cc.log(\u0026#34;成功加入聊天频道:\u0026#34;, response.channel.id); sendChatMessage(response.channel.id); }, function(error) { cc.error(\u0026#34;join channel failed:\u0026#34;, JSON.stringify(error)); } ); function sendChatMessage(channelId) { socket.writeChatMessage(channelId, {\u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Pineapple doesn\u0026#39;t belong on a pizza!\u0026#34;}).then( function(messageAck) { cc.log(\u0026#34;成功发送聊天消息:\u0026#34;, JSON.stringify(messageAck));

This article details the usage of structured log (JSON) query tools and provides practical case analyses combining multiple tools.\nWe assume there are multiple log files in the current directory, all with .log suffix. Let\u0026rsquo;s start introducing log query commands.\n🔍 Log Reading Commands # cat Command # cat is one of the most basic and commonly used commands in Linux/Unix systems, short for \u0026ldquo;concatenate\u0026rdquo;. It is mainly used to read, display, and merge file contents, and can also be used to create simple files. Here are its detailed usages:\nRead a single log file: Directly specify the filename to view the entire contents of the log file. cat test.log Read multiple specified log files: List multiple log filenames in sequence to view their contents at once (concatenated in input order). cat test1.log test2.log Read all .log files in current directory: Use wildcard * to match all files ending with .log. Contents will be displayed in \u0026ldquo;numeric \u0026gt; uppercase \u0026gt; lowercase\u0026rdquo; character sorting order. cat *.log Read log files with specific prefix: Use \u0026ldquo;prefix + wildcard\u0026rdquo; combination to precisely match target files (e.g., match all log files starting with 20250928). cat 20250928*.log Merge multiple files into a new file: Use redirection symbol \u0026gt; to merge contents of multiple files into a specified new file (Note: \u0026gt; will overwrite existing contents of the target file). cat test1.log test2.log \u0026gt; merged.log Append content to an existing file: To preserve existing contents of the target file, use redirection symbol \u0026gt;\u0026gt; to append new content to the end of the target file. cat file3.txt \u0026gt;\u0026gt; merged.txt # Append contents of file3.txt to merged.txt Read from standard input (keyboard) and save to file: When no source file is specified, cat reads from keyboard by default. Press Ctrl+d to end input and save (suitable for quickly creating short text files). cat \u0026gt; newfile.txt # Press Ctrl+d after entering content to save Read gzipped files: Use zcat command to directly read gzipped files. zcat test.log.gz Option Function Description -n Display line numbers for all lines (including empty lines) -b Display line numbers only for non-empty lines (ignore empty lines) -s Compress consecutive empty lines into one (remove extra blank lines) -E Display $ at end of each line (easy to distinguish line endings and spaces) -T Display tab characters as ^I (easy to view hidden tabs) -v Display non-printable characters (except newlines and tabs) For real-time log monitoring, you can use tail -f command\nFor very large log files, you can use less command for pagination\ncat is the most commonly used command in log querying. We can use pipes (|) to pass cat\u0026rsquo;s output to other tools for processing:\nView file and search for keywords (combining with grep):\ncat test.log | grep \u0026#34;ERROR\u0026#34; # Filter lines containing ERROR from test.log View file and sort (combining with sort):\ncat test.log | sort -n # Sort file contents numerically tail Command # View the end contents of test.log (displays last 10 lines by default) tail test.log Real-time tracking of updates to all log files in current directory, suitable for monitoring continuously written logs tail -f *.log Enhanced real-time tracking automatically follows new files when log files are rotated (e.g., archived by date) tail -F *.log less Command # Open file:\nless test.log # View test.log with pagination Can also combine with pipes to receive output from other commands:\ncat *.log | less # View merged contents of all .log files with pagination cat test.log | grep \u0026#34;error\u0026#34; | less # View log lines containing error with pagination Core operation shortcuts:\nPagination: Mouse wheel: Scroll up/down. Space / f: Scroll down one screen. b: Scroll up one screen. Enter / Up/Down arrow keys: Scroll line by line. Navigation: g: Jump to start of file. G: Jump to end of file. 50g: Jump to line 50. Search: /keyword: Search downward from current position (e.g., /ERROR searches for ERROR). ?keyword: Search upward from current position. Press n: Jump to next match. Press N: Jump to previous match. Other: q: Exit view. v: Open file in default editor at current position (convenient for editing). Ctrl+f: Scroll forward one screen (same as space). Ctrl+b: Scroll backward one screen (same as b). To preserve jq syntax highlighting in less, add -C parameter to jq and -R parameter to less Example: cat test.log | jq -C | less -R\n🎯 Log Filtering Commands # jq and Common Functions # Basic Value Extraction # .: Get the entire JSON log object, used for formatted output\nExample: cat test.log | jq '.' (format and print logs)\n-c enables compact mode, displays logs in single lines\n.key: Extract value of specified field (e.g., timestamp, level in logs)\nExample: cat test.log | jq '.level' (extract all log levels)\n.array[index]: Get specified element of array-type field (e.g., tags[0] in logs)\nExample: cat test.log | jq '.tags[1]' (extract second element of tags array)\n.key1.key2: Nested value extraction (e.g., user.name in logs)\nExample: cat test.log | jq '.request.url' (extract request URL)\nConditional Filtering # select(condition): Filter log entries that meet the condition\nExample: cat test.log | jq 'select(.level == \u0026quot;ERROR\u0026quot;)' (filter all error level logs)\nhas # Function: Determine if an object contains the specified field (commonly used in logs to check if an attribute exists)\nUsage: select(has(\u0026quot;fieldname\u0026quot;))\nExample 1: Filter error logs containing stackTrace field\ncat test.log | jq 'select(has(\u0026quot;stackTrace\u0026quot;) and .level == \u0026quot;ERROR\u0026quot;)'\nExample 2: Exclude error logs containing stackTrace field\ncat test.log | jq 'select(has(\u0026quot;stackTrace\u0026quot;) == false)'\ncontains # Function: Determine if an array/string contains specified element/substring\nUsage: select(.field | contains(target))\nExample 1 (string contains): Filter logs where message contains \u0026ldquo;timeout\u0026rdquo;\ncat test.log | jq 'select(.message | contains(\u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;))'\nExample 2 (string contains): Exclude logs where message contains \u0026ldquo;timeout\u0026rdquo;\ncat test.log | jq 'select(.message | contains(\u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;) == false)'\nExample 3 (array contains): Filter logs where tags array contains \u0026ldquo;payment\u0026rdquo;\ncat test.log | jq 'select(.tags | contains([\u0026quot;payment\u0026quot;]))'\nindex # Function: Returns starting index of substring in string (returns null if not found), used for precise position judgment\nUsage: select(.field | index(substring) != null)\nExample: Filter logs where \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; appears at position 5 or later in message\ncat test.log | jq 'select(.message | index(\u0026quot;error\u0026quot;) \u0026gt;= 5)'\ntest (Regular Expression) # Function: Determine if string matches regular expression\nUsage: select(.field | test(regular_expression))\nExample: Filter logs where first character of name is \u0026ldquo;李\u0026rdquo; (Chinese surname Li)\ncat test.log | jq 'select(.name | test(\u0026quot;^李\u0026quot;))'\nsort/uniq/group_by(array) # sort_by(field): Sort logs by specified field\nExample: Sort logs by timestamp in ascending order\ncat test.log | jq '.[] | sort_by(.timestamp)'\nunique: Array deduplication (commonly used to extract unique values)\nExample: Extract all unique userIds\ncat test.log | jq '.[] | .userId' | jq -s 'unique'\ngroup_by(field)[]: Group by field (commonly used before statistics)\nExample: Group and count logs by level\ncat test.log | jq '.[] | group_by(.level)'\nMultiple lines of independent JSON objects (not arrays) # Function: Convert multiple lines of independent JSON objects (not arrays) into an array\nExample: For non-array JSON, use -s and .[]\ncat test.log | jq -s 'sort_by(.timestamp) | .[]'\nlength # Function: Returns length of array or string\nUsage:\ncat test.log | jq '.[] | length' Get number of logs\ncat test.log | jq '.message | length' Get character count of log messages\nRename Fields # Function: Rename fields to other names Usage: # Example: Rename field \u0026#34;code\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;uid\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;cardnumber\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34; cat test.log | jq \u0026#39;with_entries(if .key == \u0026#34;code\u0026#34; then .key = \u0026#34;uid\u0026#34; elif .key == \u0026#34;cardnumber\u0026#34; then .key = \u0026#34;ID\u0026#34; else . end)\u0026#39; 📊 Log Statistical Analysis Commands # sort/uniq # Function: Used together to sort and deduplicate arrays, commonly used for log data statistics Usage: cat test.log | jq '.level' | sort | uniq wc # Function: Count number of lines, words, and bytes in logs Usage: cat test.log | wc -l Get number of log lines awk # awk is a powerful text processing tool, particularly suitable for log field extraction, conditional filtering, and statistical calculations. It processes text line by line and can split each line into fields based on delimiters.\nBasic Syntax:\nawk \u0026#39;pattern {action}\u0026#39; file # pattern is filter condition, action is processing action Extract fields by delimiter: Assume logs are space-separated, extract 1st and 3rd columns\ncat test.log | awk \u0026#39;{print $1, $3}\u0026#39; # $1 represents 1st column, $3 represents 3rd column Specify delimiter: Use -F to specify delimiter (e.g., comma, colon, etc.)\ncat test.log | awk -F \u0026#39;,\u0026#39; \u0026#39;{print $2}\u0026#39; # Split by comma, extract 2nd column Conditional filtering: Only process lines that meet the conditions\ncat test.log | awk \u0026#39;$3 \u0026gt; 100 {print $0}\u0026#39; # Filter lines where 3rd column value \u0026gt; 100 cat test.log | awk \u0026#39;/ERROR/ {print $0}\u0026#39; # Filter lines containing ERROR Statistical counting: Use built-in variables NR (line number) and NF (number of fields)\ncat test.log | awk \u0026#39;END {print NR}\u0026#39; # Count total number of lines cat test.log | awk \u0026#39;{sum+=$3} END {print sum}\u0026#39; # Sum values in 3rd column and output total Formatted output: Use printf to customize output format\ncat test.log | awk \u0026#39;{printf \u0026#34;Level: %s, Message: %s\\n\u0026#34;, $1, $2}\u0026#39; Multiple condition combinations: Combine logical operators (\u0026amp;\u0026amp;, ||, !)\ncat test.log | awk \u0026#39;$1==\u0026#34;ERROR\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; $3\u0026gt;50 {print $0}\u0026#39; #

Undoubtedly, Python has the most concise syntax among mainstream programming languages. Coupled with its rich built-in functions, proficiency in Python can significantly reduce code volume and development time when solving algorithm problems.\nStudents targeting ICPC/CCPC competitions often choose C++ for performance reasons. However, programming problems encountered in ordinary competitions or interviews do not typically constrain language runtime— as long as the algorithm\u0026rsquo;s time complexity meets requirements, it will pass. Therefore, once you become accustomed to using Python for algorithm problems, you can improve efficiency and appreciate Python\u0026rsquo;s elegance.\nCommon Techniques # Counter # c = Counter(list) for k, v in c.items(): print(k, v) for k in c.keys(): print(k, c[k]) for v in c.values(): print(v) for i in c.elements(): print(i) dict = defaultdict(list) # default to empty list dict = defaultdict(int) # default to 0 for k, v in dict: print(k, v) Comprehensions # # List comprehension newnames = [name.upper() for name in names if len(name) \u0026gt; 3] multiples = [i for i in range(30) if i % 3 == 0] # Dictionary comprehension newdict = {key: len(key) for key in listdemo} dic = {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)} # Set comprehension newset = {i**2 for i in (1, 2, 3)} a = {x for x in \u0026#39;abracadabra\u0026#39; if x not in \u0026#39;abc\u0026#39;} Custom Sorting # data = [(\u0026#39;red\u0026#39;, 5), (\u0026#39;blue\u0026#39;, 1), (\u0026#39;yellow\u0026#39;, 8), (\u0026#39;black\u0026#39;, 0)] data.sort(key=lambda r: r[1]) # Custom sort function def custom_sort_key(item): # Generate sort key based on some property of item return item[\u0026#39;priority\u0026#39;] # Assume we sort by priority # Example data items = [ {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39;: 2}, {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39;: 1}, {\u0026#39;name\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;priority\u0026#39;: 3}, ] # Use sorted() for sorting sorted_items = sorted(items, key=custom_sort_key) print(sorted_items) # Output sorted list # Use list.sort() for in-place sorting items.sort(key=custom_sort_key) print(items) # Output in-place sorted list Memoization # from functools import cache # Use @cache decorator before function to enable memoization Binary Search Functions # import bisect my_list = [1, 3, 5, 5, 7, 9] # Use bisect_left to find insertion position (leftmost) left_index = bisect.bisect_left(my_list, 5) print(\u0026#34;Insertion position (leftmost):\u0026#34;, left_index) # Use bisect_right to find insertion position (rightmost) right_index = bisect.bisect_right(my_list, 5) print(\u0026#34;Insertion position (rightmost):\u0026#34;, right_index) # Output: # Insertion position (leftmost): 2 # Insertion position (rightmost): 4 # Detailed usage: bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a), *, key=None) Finds the first index in [lo, hi) of list a where element \u0026gt;= x bisect.bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a), *, key=None) Finds the first index in [lo, hi) of list a where element \u0026gt; x # Custom comparison rule my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] index = bisect.bisect_left(my_list, 5, key=lambda x: x * x) # Application example: Grade classification def grade(score, breakpoints=[60, 70, 80, 90], grades=\u0026#39;FDCBA\u0026#39;): i = bisect.bisect(breakpoints, score) return grades[i] [grade(score) for score in [33, 99, 77, 70, 89, 90, 100]] [\u0026#39;F\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;C\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;B\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;A\u0026#39;] General Template # This template is for ICPC/CCPC competitions.

Each commit requires a message describing the changes made, helping collaborators quickly review and understand the development progress, thereby improving collaboration efficiency. Currently, the Angular convention is the most widely adopted Git commit message standard.\nThis article references the following documents and provides a beginner-friendly guide:\nAngular GitHub Convention Reference Blog Convention Details # Commit Message Format # \u0026lt;type\u0026gt;(\u0026lt;scope\u0026gt;): \u0026lt;subject\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BLANK LINE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;BLANK LINE\u0026gt; \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; Among these, type and subject are mandatory, while scope is optional. The first line is the Header (title), the second part is the Body (summary), and the last part is the Footer (notes).\nIn practical development, it\u0026rsquo;s common to primarily follow the header convention, i.e., type(scope): subject. Examples are as follows:\nfeat(Extracurricular Activities): Display extracurricular activity credits fix(Extracurricular Activities): Fix issue with displaying extracurricular activity credits docs: Add environment setup tutorial for newcomers in README test: Unit tests for Academic System API Type # Commonly used Type values include:\nfeat: A new feature fix: A bug fix docs: Documentation changes style: Changes that do not affect code logic (e.g., formatting) refactor: Code refactoring that is neither a new feature nor a bug fix perf: Performance improvements test: Adding or modifying tests chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools Scope # Specifies the module or file scope affected by the commit. For example:\nExtracurricular Activities Academic System Subject # It is recommended to use Chinese.
